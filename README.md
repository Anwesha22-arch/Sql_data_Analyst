# Background
    Breaking into the data analytics field can feel overwhelming — endless tools, skills, and job titles. To make this journey clearer, I set out to explore real-world data and uncover what truly matters in the data analyst job market.

    1.Which data analyst roles offer the highest    salaries?

    2.What skills are necessary to land these top-earning data analyst positions?

    3.Which skills are currently the most in-demand for data analysts?

    4.Which skills show a strong correlation with higher salaries?

    5.What are the most valuable and strategic skills to learn for a successful data analyst career?

By analyzing job postings, salary trends, and skill frequency data, I aimed to remove guesswork and provide a data-driven roadmap for aspiring analysts like me.
# Tools I Used
🛠 Tools I Used

To explore the data analyst job landscape effectively, I leveraged a set of powerful tools throughout this project:

    -**SQL:** The core of this analysis — used to filter, join, and extract meaningful insights from job posting data.

    -**PostgreSQL:** My database of choice for storing and managing the dataset, offering reliability and strong analytical querying capabilities.

    -**Visual Studio Code:** The primary environment where I wrote, tested, and refined my SQL queries, making development smooth and organized.

    -**Git & GitHub:** Used for version control and maintaining a clean project structure — tracking progress, backing up work, and sharing my code confidently.
# The Analysis
